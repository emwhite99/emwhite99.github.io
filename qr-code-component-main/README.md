## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

This is my first solo project outside of the Udemy courses I have been taking! For the HTML portion of this project, I created a main section for the QR code and text and put the attribution to Frontend Mentor in a footer section. I linked the Google Fonts page to ensure the font would show correctly in the browser. I had no major challenges with the HTML.

The CSS portion of the project was where I had to do most of my experimenting. One of the most difficult things to format was the vertical and horizontal centering of the main content. I was able to find a solution to align my content correctly on Stack Overflow through some research. I went with this solution:

```css
.content {
  position: absolute;
  margin: 0;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateY(-50%) translateX(-50%);
}
```

Through this small project I was able to test out my comprehension of basic HTML and CSS, test out my research skills, and experiment with CSS. I was much slower than I would have expected, but I am sure that more practice will bring me up to a level of production that I am more satisfied with.

### Continued development

I will continue creating solo projects with increasing difficulty until I feel comfortable tackling most of the basic elements that are used in current websites. I will memorize more of the syntax for HTML and CSS as I go and make sure I follow best practices. Publishing my solution will also introduce me to peer code review, and I plan to utilize that feedback to improve my projects in the future.
